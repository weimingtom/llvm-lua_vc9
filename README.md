# llvm-lua_vc9
llvm-lua 1.2.0 vc9 building, only for fun, DONNOT USE IT !!!  

## How to build it  
It's an old build for vc9. I want to rebuild it in other way.  
See require.txt and static_lib.txt, LLVM 2.7 is required.   
I have removed lib files of LLVM, see static_lib.txt.  

## NOTICE 
DONNOT USE IT !!!  
Only for my studying and playing.    
Prebuild see folder vendor.
